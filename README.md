# GenAI-Usages-Reports
This repository provides the data and code associated with the CHI'26 publication about GenAI usage disclosures made by GenAI providers.

We will release the dataset publically once our institution will have approved our request.


In the dataset: 
If a question-temporality cell is empty, the document does not answer the question.
If a question-temporality cell is not empty, we added illustrative quotes from the document corresponding to that cell.
We recognize that we might be missing certain quotes due to this process being a manual one, prone to human errors.

For the "which" questions, we did not annotate units of analysis comprehensively as they were all very similar.
